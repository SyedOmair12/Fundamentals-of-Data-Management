I have designed and created a comprehensive Hospital Database System that incorporates best practices. The system manages hospitals, doctors, patients, workers, and pharmacies. Each hospital is uniquely identified by its ID, name, and address and may have multiple branches. Hospitals specialize in specific categories and have various rooms. They employ doctors who are identified by their ID, name, and date of birth and are specialized in a particular category. Doctors work across different branches and treat multiple patients. Patients are identified by their ID, name, and date of birth and are treated by one or more doctors. Each patient has their own billing information. Additionally, the system tracks workers within the hospital, identified by their ID and name. Furthermore, hospitals can have zero or one associated pharmacies, which are identified by their ID, name, and address.

I am proud to have created this hospital database system while adhering to industry best practices. It efficiently manages hospital operations, doctor-patient relationships, and overall healthcare services. This project demonstrates my expertise in database design and management and showcases my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.
